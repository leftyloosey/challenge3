# UofU Coding Bootcamp Challenge 3#

## Welcome

to the third challenge. This will be a refactoring of some code, and the 
addition some new lines of javascript, in order to make a random password 
generator. Right now I'm working in a separate, sandbox-mode script.js 
file just to be able to work out the rough outline of how the eventual 
script will work.
